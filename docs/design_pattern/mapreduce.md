# Map Reduce

MapReduce is a design pattern suitable when you have either:

- Large input data (e.g., multiple files to process), or
- Large output data (e.g., multiple forms to fill)

and there is a logical way to break the task into smaller, ideally independent parts.

<div align="center">

</div>

You first break down the task using [BatchNode](../core_abstraction/batch.md) in the map phase, followed by aggregation in the reduce phase.

### Example: Document Summarization

```python
class SummarizeAllFiles(BatchNode):
    def prep(self, shared):
        files_dict = shared["files"]  # e.g. 10 files
        return list(files_dict.items())  # [("file1.txt", "aaa..."), ("file2.txt", "bbb..."), ...]

    def exec(self, one_file):
        filename, file_content = one_file
        summary_text = call_llm(f"Summarize the following file:\n{file_content}")
        return (filename, summary_text)

    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
        shared["file_summaries"] = dict(exec_res_list)

class CombineSummaries(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        return shared["file_summaries"]

    def exec(self, file_summaries):
        # format as: "File1: summary\nFile2: summary...\n"
        text_list = []
        for fname, summ in file_summaries.items():
            text_list.append(f"{fname} summary:\n{summ}\n")
        big_text = "\n---\n".join(text_list)

        return call_llm(f"Combine these file summaries into one final summary:\n{big_text}")

    def post(self, shared, prep_res, final_summary):
        shared["all_files_summary"] = final_summary

batch_node = SummarizeAllFiles()
combine_node = CombineSummaries()
batch_node >> combine_node

flow = Flow(start=batch_node)

shared = {
    "files": {
        "file1.txt": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister...",
        "file2.txt": "Some other interesting text ...",
        # ...
    }
}
flow.run(shared)
print("Individual Summaries:", shared["file_summaries"])
print("\nFinal Summary:\n", shared["all_files_summary"])
```

> **Performance Tip**: The example above works sequentially. You can speed up the map phase by running it in parallel. See [(Advanced) Parallel](../core_abstraction/parallel.md) for more details.
