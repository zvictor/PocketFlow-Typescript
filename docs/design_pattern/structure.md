# Structured Output

In many use cases, you may want the LLM to output a specific structure, such as a list or a dictionary with predefined keys.

There are several approaches to achieve a structured output:

- **Prompting** the LLM to strictly return a defined structure.
- Using LLMs that natively support **schema enforcement**.
- **Post-processing** the LLM's response to extract structured content.

In practice, **Prompting** is simple and reliable for modern LLMs.

### Example Use Cases

- Extracting Key Information

```yaml
product:
  name: Widget Pro
  price: 199.99
  description: |
    A high-quality widget designed for professionals.
    Recommended for advanced users.
```

- Summarizing Documents into Bullet Points

```yaml
summary:
  - This product is easy to use.
  - It is cost-effective.
  - Suitable for all skill levels.
```

- Generating Configuration Files

```yaml
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  ssl: true
```

## Prompt Engineering

When prompting the LLM to produce **structured** output:

1. **Wrap** the structure in code fences (e.g., `yaml`).
2. **Validate** that all required fields exist (and let `Node` handles retry).

### Example Text Summarization

````python
class SummarizeNode(Node):
    def exec(self, prep_res):
        # Suppose `prep_res` is the text to summarize.
        prompt = f"""
Please summarize the following text as YAML, with exactly 3 bullet points

{prep_res}

Now, output:
```yaml
summary:
  - bullet 1
  - bullet 2
  - bullet 3
```"""
        response = call_llm(prompt)
        yaml_str = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()

        import yaml
        structured_result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)

        assert "summary" in structured_result
        assert isinstance(structured_result["summary"], list)

        return structured_result
````

### Why YAML instead of JSON?

Current LLMs struggle with escaping. YAML is easier with strings since they don't always need quotes.

**In JSON**

```json
{
  "dialogue": "Alice said: \"Hello Bob.\\nHow are you?\\nI am good.\""
}
```

- Every double quote inside the string must be escaped with `\"`.
- Each newline in the dialogue must be represented as `\n`.

**In YAML**

```yaml
dialogue: |
  Alice said: "Hello Bob.
  How are you?
  I am good."
```

- No need to escape interior quotes—just place the entire text under a block literal (`|`).
- Newlines are naturally preserved without needing `\n`.
